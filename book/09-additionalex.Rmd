## Exercises

**Exercise 1**

Describe the behaviour of the ACF and PACF for ARMA models. How does the behaviour of the ACF/PACF help identifying an ARMA model?

**Exercise 2**

Show that the following AR(2) model is stationary:

$$
y_t = 0.6 y_{t-1} - 0.08 y_{t-2} + \varepsilon_t
$$

**Exercise 3**

Show that the kurtosis of an ARCH(1,1) process is 

$$
\mathbb{E}[\sigma_t^4] = \sigma^4(1+\alpha^2) - \alpha \mu_4 \sigma^4 \frac{1-\alpha^2}{1-\alpha^2 \mu_4}
$$

**Exercise 4**
Consider the process
$$
y_t = \delta + \sum_{s=1}^t \varepsilon_s + x_t
$$

where $\varepsilon_t$ is i.i.d. and $x_t$ is a covariance-stationary process with $\mathbb{E}[x_t] = 0$. Show that $y_t$ is an $I(1)$ process.
